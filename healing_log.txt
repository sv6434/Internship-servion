False is not true : Validation failed: Match count should not be negative
Suggested Fix:
Here is the valid SQL UPDATE query:
```sql
UPDATE players
SET matches_played = ABS(matches_played)
WHERE matches_played < 0;
```
This query updates the `matches_played` column of the `players` table by setting any negative values to their absolute value using the `ABS()` function. The `WHERE` clause ensures that only rows with non-positive values are updated.

False is not true : Validation failed: Player names should be unique
Suggested Fix:
To remove all but one of each duplicate entry, we can use the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses with a subquery.

Here is an example SQL query that should help:

```sql
DELETE p1
FROM players p1
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT MAX(id) 
  FROM players p2 
  WHERE p1.name = p2.name
)
```

This query works by comparing each row in the `players` table (`p1`) with all rows that have the same `name` and selecting only the row(s) with the maximum `id`. The rest of the rows are then deleted.

Note: Before running this query, make sure to backup your database!
